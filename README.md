# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on the famous MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a key application of image classification that has been widely studied and is useful in many real-world applications such as digitizing handwritten documents and creating automated systems for reading handwritten forms.

This project uses a deep learning approach with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN built with layers optimized for image classification tasks.
- **Training**: Trains the model with training data and evaluates its performance on test data.
- **Prediction**: Classifies new, unseen images of handwritten digits.
- **Visualization**: Displays results, such as sample predictions and model accuracy graphs.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` for building and training the neural network
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations
  - `Matplotlib` for visualizations
  - `Scikit-learn` for additional data processing and evaluation

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
